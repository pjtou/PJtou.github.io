                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"></p><p><strong>Philosophical Foundation</strong></p><p>In the piece I will try to show some similarities and differences between philosophical foundation used in Hellenistic Astrology and Hindu Astrology, we will try to see how their philosophical foundation informs astrological symbols and helps to understand the purpose of astrology. &nbsp;My contention is that the Shankhya foundation in Indian astrology while similar to some of Plato's ideas, offers a more integrated basis to astrology, that did the several philosophical schools of Greek philosophy.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Greek Astrology and Philosophy&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>What is called western astrology, can be thought to stem from Persian / Mesopotamian / Egyptian astrology, given what is left from hellenistic Antiquity. &nbsp;The texts we still have are not clear on this point, and what is left from the earliest authors or Sages are only fragments, scattered in several authors, like Hephaistio, nor had their underlying philosophy really made it across time to Dorotheus de Sidon, 1st century AD, Ptolemy, Vettius Valens, both 2nd century AD and other like Hephaisto of Thebes, 5th century AD. &nbsp; So they strove to find Greek philosophical ideas to express or understand astrology. &nbsp;But the earlier astrologers referenced by them were Berossus, Asclepius, Nechepso and Petosiris, the last 2 being Egyptians. &nbsp;These had astrology schools and still had access to earliest methods and teachings. &nbsp;Their time period is lost, though scholars puts them in the last 2nd or 3rd centuries before JC. &nbsp;But there are references to the Tomb of Petosiris in 4th century BCE, and of Nechepso the "King", from 7th century BCE on &nbsp;encyclopedic articles under their name. &nbsp;Another ancient divine figure is of course, Hermes Trismegistus, date unknown, who may have been a Sage or a god, or perhaps like the Rishis of India. </p><p>The astrology books and methods written in Greek, were transmitted to us via the Persians, Arabs around the 8th century, and then via European astrologers of the middle age.   So it was something of a lost art at the time of Valens, and therefore there wasn’t nor is there now, a solid cosmological and philosophical foundation, that this writer is aware of. &nbsp; There may have been such a unique foundation in the Babylonian or Mesopotamian astrology, but it hasnt made it to us. &nbsp; The reason I am writing this is that the astrology methods were similar. &nbsp; 12 signs and zodiac coming from Mespopotamia, before the 3rd and 4th century, probably before the 6th cenury. &nbsp;The zodiac was sidereal because all extent ancient charts, starting from 410 BCE were sidereal. &nbsp; We do not have a single tropical chart in ancient Greek astrology! &nbsp; But as for Mesopotamian astrology, the system has not made it to us. &nbsp; Scholars assume from the texts that Mesopotamians were only doing general astrology for some elevated figures like the Kings, and for countries, or for divination. &nbsp; &nbsp;For this reason, nearly all scholars believe that natal astrology, for human beings is a Greek modification or invention, which is just a guess in my view due to the meager amount of texts from earlier periods.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course there were philosophical elements in those Greek texts. &nbsp; Recent writers such as Robert Schmidt have made a fascinating linguistic study of the Greek texts and found elements and philosophical concepts of Form and Matter, the Same and the Other, referring to Plato and Aristotle, 3rd century BC, Empedocles 4th century BC, among other Greek philosophers, and have derived insights from these. These insights are applied to Signs, Planets and Aspects, the 3 building blocks of astrology. &nbsp; For instance Aspect is a visual term. &nbsp; Aspects were sometimes named "glances" in Valens and the Greek philosophical ideas associated with looking at an object became a focus for understanding relations between planets. &nbsp;So if there is an Aspect between 2 planets, it means that one or both planets, are able to see the other, and therefore connect, impart a signification one to the other.</p>For Plato, &nbsp;"philosophers considered the heavens to be moved by immaterial agents. Plato believed the cause to be a world-soul, created according to mathematical principles, which governed the daily motion of the heavens (the motion of the Same) and the opposed motions of the planets along the zodiac (the motion of the Different) [Cornford]. &nbsp; In Plato the Form is mathematically ordered with numbers. &nbsp;<br>Here is what Plato writes in Timaeus : &nbsp;""a description of what is changeless, fixed and clearly intelligible will be changeless and fixed," (29b), while a description of what changes and is likely, will also change and be just likely. "As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief" (29c). Therefore, in a description of the physical world, one "should not look for anything more than a likely story" (29d).<br>This view relates to the idea in Shankhya that the original principle or "idea" of the world is beyond the obvious, beyond material. &nbsp; But if we study nature, (Prakriti) we only have a "likely story". &nbsp;In Shankhya, Purusha or Spirit, or Consciousness, is eternal and immaterial, it always exists, and is a first cause of everything that exists. &nbsp; For Plato, the Form (capitalised) is the original principle hidden behind the physical world of nature and matter. &nbsp; We could say that This Form is divine, imbued with awareness and causing things. &nbsp;So there is similarity or agreement with Shankhya that nature (Prakriti in Shankhya) is animated by a mysterious imperceptible agent, Purusha, or perhaps the Form in Plato. &nbsp; Also, Shankhya itself is a word meaning "enumeration" or number, which is intriguing in relation to the number system that Plato and Pythagoras say orders the universe.&nbsp;<br><p><br>In De Mundo, Aristotle or a writer thought to be Aristotle mentions a theory of rotating planetary Spheres being the source of all events on earth. &nbsp; This is quite intriguing because such a cosmos is ordered by deities, who arrange all events, in Surya Siddantha. &nbsp; This is a very old (date unknown) and sacred Indian sanskrit text considered an astronomical and cosmological model of the Divine Planets and their theory. &nbsp;This texts was writen by Rishis, Sages in traditional Indian lore. &nbsp;To find this mention of Planetary Spheres in (or claimed to be from) Aristotle and also in Plato and Ptolemy (Almagest) shows a link between India and the Middle east. &nbsp;Because Surya Siddantha has a solid history and foundation in India, it would be more likely that its origin is in the Middle east. &nbsp;The other reason wht its more likely from India, is that the Surya Siddantha still contains elaborate mathematics and astronomical equations, though they are kept in secrecy mostly.</p><p>Yet in Plato there are concepts reminiscent of the Divine Planets. &nbsp;Plato posits a world of Forms, which are uncreated, not perceivable be the senses, and always exist. &nbsp;We &nbsp;see that this even might connect with the Shankhya notion of Purusha we will describe. &nbsp; But those Divine Planets and their revolutions can possibly be related to the Planetary Spheres mentionned in De Mundo.</p><p>Ptolemy and Vettius Valens make an effort to link Aristotelian ideas with Astrology, and also Valens, to Stoic ideas. &nbsp; For example, we find the 4 Elements theory in Ptolemy and Valens, &nbsp;discussed by Aristotle, Empedocles, and then the Stoics. &nbsp; There is always a 5th element in Hindu philosophy, which doesnto appear in modern western astrology, and we also find it in Plato and ancient Greeks, as the Quintessense, or the 5th essence, or 5th element, which comprise of the Sphere of [fixed] stars in the firmament. &nbsp;So even though neither Aristotle, Empedocles nor Plato were astrologers, they took astrology as a given, had opinions on its use, even if they did not leave any astrological writings per se. </p><p>The case of Ptolemy is very interesting because the influence of Aristotle on him shows as a season-based set of influence bearing on zodiac signs and planets. &nbsp; The ratio of humidity, dryness, heat and cold, coming from Aristotle, is used by himself and then Ptolemy the effects and causes of the 4 Elements, and then of planets. &nbsp; And these quite material effects are seen as causal for Ptolemy, meaning, seasons, temperature, wetness begin to be causal on the affairs of men and countries. &nbsp;Ptolemy became enormously influential in the centuries after his life, and his natural causal views remained very important for astrologers using his tropical zodiac in the western world to this day. &nbsp; This despite several philosophers like Plotinus (3rd century AD) deriding the notion of planets causing events : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp;"-If one says that if the bird flies high is signifies some high heroic deed. &nbsp;But if because, looking at the stars, they announce what has happened to particular people, they adduce this as evidence that the happenings were caused by the stars, then in the same way, birds would be the causes of what they indicate, and so would everything at which the soothsayers look when they foretell."<br>The debate between natural causes and astrology showing signs to life events remained throughout history in Europe, in fact this debate is still prevalent today. &nbsp; And the natural causes prevailed often, but we will see how this view wasnt supported in India.&nbsp;<br>So it seems more likely that Ptolemy was trying to find a philosophical support using the very famous Aristotle, in order to elaborate an astrological system having a philosophical foundation. </p><p>Platon in Timaeus has described an ideal ancient city suggesting under the mythic story a cosmological system, if not an astrological theory. &nbsp; In Timaeus we find the idea of Spheres surrounding the earth on which planets and the stars revolve. &nbsp;Arab astrologers in the 12th century will actually comment that these Spheres might possibly be "abstract" places : &nbsp;" Fakhr al-Din al-Razi about whether the celestial spheres are real, concrete physical bodies or "merely the abstract circles in the heavens traced out… by the various stars and planets." </p><p>Or as Plato would say, these are "ideal" spheres on which celestial planets move. &nbsp; This connects once more to the Surya Siddantha notion that planets are not physical bodies, but divine in origin, planets being deities. &nbsp;In Surya Siddantha these planets revolve on divine planes, not physical planes, and these have different measurements. &nbsp;The divine cosmos has a smaller size and the orbits are all slightly different than the physical measurements known to scientists. &nbsp;Plato did not explicitely say that, but if his ideal Spheres stem from some ancient philosophy in Egypt, Mesopotomia or India, it may have begun to be half forgotten during his time in the 4th century BCE. &nbsp; Or he left it himself half explained for occult reasons. &nbsp;We have to remember that the known history does not go much before the 6 and 7 th century even though mystical philosophers like Rudolf Steiner have commented how very much more ancient is the history of astrology in India and Persia, going back to antediluvian worlds. &nbsp;</p><p>Some recent writers like Liz Greene, have interpreted Planets in terms of Greek mythology, (Planets of Fate, Weiser, 1985). &nbsp; She derived insights on the meaning of planets from the Greek gods apparented to them. &nbsp; These gods originate from Mesopotamia. &nbsp;It is quite interesting, but if we bear in mind that the Astrology written in Greek at those times does not come from the pre-Christian Greek culture, but rather from ancient Persia, Mesopotamia, probably Egypt, and probably also India. &nbsp;So if the gods named in Greek, like Zeus for Jupiter, Chronos for Saturn, Hermes for Mercury etc. &nbsp;do have a correlation to the planets, the idea to seek interpretive material from Greek mythology may be have some gaps, be somewhat daring or speculative. &nbsp;She wrote for instance, that Zeus is known for his love affairs and jealousies, and from this deems Jupiter a promiscuous lover ready to cheat his wife. &nbsp; Such views would not be possible in eastern Indian astrology, which views Jupiter as a Brahmin, an adviser, a guru, a spiritual person. &nbsp; Jupiter is always concerned with truth and spiritual and worldly rules. &nbsp; At any rate, a philosophical foundation to the cosmology of middle-eastern astrology written in Greek in the first few centuries AD, is not complete. &nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, it seems that these astrologers of the early middle east, in the effervescent intellectual times of Alexandria of the 1st century AD, and probably sometime before and after that, were trying to understand books and ideas that were long gone. &nbsp; Vettius Valens was travelling far and wide trying to find the source and secrets of an astrology whose source was in the distant past. &nbsp;There was metaphysical ideas throughout Plato and Greek philosophers, but a native &nbsp;astrological philosophy is not imbred in the philosophy of those times. &nbsp;All these are quite a contrast to the Indian writings. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Indian Astrology and Sankhya</strong>
<br>
<br>Indian astrology on the contrary, is based on a philosophical system, even a cosmological scheme, or at least it uses philosophical ideas with enormous roots in Indian philosophy, and for this there are 2 condidates, &nbsp;Samkhya philosophy and Surya Siddantha. &nbsp; In the 1980s and 90s R. Santhanam and Kapoor produced their english translation of Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra (2), by Rishi Parasara, followed by the translation of G Sharma, and it became the foremost authoritative book, in and outside of India.  Likewise, the first few chapters of Lomasha Samhita were published on the Saptarishis.com website in the 2010s.  Both Lomasha and&nbsp; Parasara are long known to be some of the 18 Rishis (Sages) who taught Astrology to mankind.  &nbsp;The first few chapters of BPHS and Lomasha do contain delineations of astrological ideas in terms of Shankhya.  &nbsp;Most importantly the planets are understood from the Gunas, Elements, Doshas and these principles are solid known basic principles in several ancient Indian schools of philosophy and Ayurveda. &nbsp; These are clear Shankhya notions that are discussed in the root text of Shankhya by Kapila, and also discussed at length in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Puranas. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br>Both texts, BPHS and Lomasha are quite similar in approach, showing astrological teachings being given to a chosen student, and they write about the  role of Krishna, Vishnu, as main founding God, each being an image of the same figure, and then about many deities and gods associated with the planets understood as Grahas. &nbsp;The Grahas are not physical bodies, but deities whose role is “to give humans the fruits of their karma” to quote Parasara. &nbsp; A similar idea of Planets not being bodies but deities is repeated several times in Surya Siddantha and the Puranas. &nbsp; The orbits and revolutions are sometimes written as Divya (divine) revolutions, not physical revolutions. &nbsp;So a metaphysical and spiritual foundation is given from the start.  Grahas or planets are deities and not mere physical bodies, and they are endowed with qualities such as Gunas, one of the 5 Elements, which are not described in materialistic terms in Indian philosophy as they are in Greek philosophy, and then Grahas possess many other qualities and associations with the material worlds, but these associations are given AFTER the divine or spiritual associations to deities and Gunas are given.  Meaning the material crystallisations are a result of the spiritual precipitations into nature, into Prakriti. 
<br>
<br>Shankhya and Indian philosophy in general, are difficult texts to approach from a westerner's point of view. &nbsp; Shankhya describes a world whose origin is not physical.  Actually in Genesis an immaterial origin was also shown.  Here is Genesis 1, International translation:
<br>
<br>“In the beginning&nbsp;God created&nbsp;the heavens&nbsp;and the earth.&nbsp;2&nbsp;Now the earth was formless&nbsp;and empty,&nbsp;darkness was over the surface of the deep,&nbsp;and the Spirit of God&nbsp;was hovering&nbsp;over the waters.” 
<br>
<br>These are very allusive and evocative images which are deep and mystical and would require extended study.  But Genesis and the Bible are not used in western astrological texts. &nbsp; And since the Renaissance in the west, studying nature with the intellect has become the norm, and astrology is frowned as superstition and old wives tales. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>Shamhya is used in Indian astrology. &nbsp;It is often described as a dualistic philosophy, because it holds 2 realities as basic principles of the world, Purusha and Prakriti. &nbsp;Of these, Purusha is the Self, or Spirit, or Consciousness. &nbsp;Some writers have seen Purusha synonimous with Atman, or Soul. &nbsp;Purusha is a divine essence, it is spiritual. &nbsp;Purusha relates to an individual identity as being spiritual and being a spirit.  Purusha is totally immaterial. And this is a very important notion, because if Purusha is immaterial it is not perceivable by the senses !   
<br>
<br>On the contrary Prakriti is nature.  Actually Prakriti is unmanifest Nature.  And Shankhya being an enumeration (the word means number) of a many principles present in the world, describes its precipitation into nature.   During incarnation, Prakriti begins from being unmanifest,  on to a state of mind called Mahat, or Budhi, which intellects the world, to a more disctint individual awareness point of view which is Ahamkara.   This Ahamkara is part of the mind.  Ahamakara we call Ego in the west.  It is the state of being, or having a separate identity from other beings.  But for Shankhya, this is an illusion of being separate, since at the unmanifested core there is no separation of one Spirit and another Spirit. &nbsp; In Purusha, we are Purusha, we are one. &nbsp; Yet Purusha being such an elevated position of consciousness, requires the discipline of the yogi to become actual for a person. &nbsp;It is unreachable to ordinary people.</p><p>Parasara gives Ahamkara to the moon. &nbsp;He gives the Self or the Soul to the Sun, though it is unclear that this Soul is the ONE Soul, or more an individual Spirit. &nbsp; It actually is more like the individual Spirit of a human being, because every chart has a sun somewhere which is related to the unique Self of that person. &nbsp; This is perhaps a little like Purusha. &nbsp;</p><p>Prakriti then continues its precipitation, incarnation, materialisation into the 3 Gunas, then differents instruments called the 5 subtle elements, 5 gross elements , 5 organs of cognition and action.  
<br>Prakriti as nature is a process by which consciousness descends into physical matter, through the mind, Ego, subtle organs of cognitions, 5 senses of perceptions and then organs used in order to act upon the world.  This concludes the materialisation into physical matter of a consciousness which had, it is surmissed, decided to create, enjoy, manifest life, on another level from its own.</p><p>Indian astrology follows the Shankhya scheme, with Parasara giving the 5 elements to the 5 Starry planets. &nbsp;They are in the usual Indian order of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, for fire, earth, ether, water and air. &nbsp; Note that in older western texts like William Lilly these 5 elements were still remembered as a side note.<br>
<br>The 5 senses of Prakriti are able to perceive nature to some extent at least.  Shankhya  describes Prakriti at length with its 24 tattvas, or true principles, given above. &nbsp;There is a last tattva, the 25th being Purusha itself, &nbsp;and this one is transcendant, and is not perceivable by the Senses.   See the table below for the map of Prakriti. 
<br>
<br>So these Sankhya concepts forming a description of what ancient Sages have “seen” of the world, with its origin outside any access by the senses, we can see how our modern world will have difficulty accepting such a viewpoint.   Most philosophical systems born in the west since the Renaissance, and even before, are reasonned out processes and intellectual constructions. &nbsp;All modern sciences are attempting to describe what they see in matter and nature, and from that extrapolate to what the entire world must be like.  They use instruments to refine what the senses fail to see, like microscopes, telescopes. &nbsp;Still they are unable to locate consciousness, love,  God, Spirit, within matter. &nbsp;For the most part, they are actually surprisingly uninterested in these things. &nbsp; What they cannot see must not exist, they tell us. &nbsp;Dont speculate on God, they tell us. &nbsp;We never have proof of God. &nbsp;We want proof.&nbsp;<br>
<br>Since the Renaissance and what we can call the birth of modern science, the approach to knowledge took on a decidedly materialistic approach.  Before the Renaissance the savants were called Natural Philosophers.   They were looking at spirituality and nature in an inclusive, non materialistic way.  They did not say we separate spirit which we will not study, and matter which we will study.  They were studying chemistry, alchemy, medicine, astrology, religion without the skeptical distinction of modern times.  They had not taken on the skepticism and materialism which have infused every aspect of modern life. &nbsp;They began their inquiry from the opposite side from where the Shankhya Rishis started out.  Those Rishis worked from yogic consciousness which they elaborated on in Vedic texts.   They explained that once their mind where cleared of obstructions thru their extended meditative disciplines, they were able to see the world and its myriad aspects as maya, &nbsp;an illusory image. &nbsp;But the underlying principles of the world are what they describe in Shankhya and other philosophical systems like Advaita and Yoga, the Vedas and Puranas. &nbsp;To us then, who cannot have access to expanded consciousness, Shankhya seems pure speculation as we cannot see, smell, hear or feel Purusha, and we cannot prove, the key word of western science, its existence. Nor can we prove the Gunas are present in nature or human beings. &nbsp;We can say there maybe an energy there. &nbsp;But we are unsure what it is. &nbsp;We are not trained to know it. &nbsp; we are trained to be skeptical. &nbsp;Now to a Rishi who sees the world outside of physical eyes or senses, modern science, by looking only at Prakriti, nature, is using a part of the mind, Mahat, Budhi, and Ahamkara, that Shankhya has described as fragmented, a part of the mind not being the whole of consciousness. &nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion this piece elucidates some aspects of Shankhya present in Indian astrology, how Greek astrology has some suggestive elements that were part of the Greek philosophy of the time, from Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics and before them, but not as clearly rooted in philosophy as is Jyotish and Shankhya.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Pierre T fev. 2018</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>1 &nbsp;Hellenistic Astrology, Chris Brennan, 2017, Amor Fati Publications, page 152.</p><p>2 &nbsp;Brihat Parasata Hora Sastra, transl.
