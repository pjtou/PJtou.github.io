                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"><strong>Egyptian Astrology and Philosophy</strong>
<br><br>What is called western astrology, is more like the remnant of Egyptian / Mesopotamian/ Persian astrology, itself a remnant from a distant past, as written by Ptolemy and Vettius Valens themselves.  These methods were transmitted to us via the Arabs, and then via European astrologers of the middle age.   So it was something of a lost art at the time of Valens, in the 2nd century AD, and therefore there wasn’t nor is there now, a solid cosmological and philosophical foundation to it, that this writer is aware of. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>But there were philosophical elements in those texts.  Recent writers such as Robert Schmidt have made a fascinating linguistic study of the Greek texts and found intriguing hints of philosophical concepts of Form and Matter, referring to Aristotle, 3rd century BC, Empedocles 4th century BC, Plato, among other Greek philosophers, and have derived insights from these. These insights are applied to Signs, Planets and Aspects, the 3 building blocks of astrology.  But a whole cosmological or philosophical foundation to the astrology of Ptolemy and V. Valens (both 2nd Century BC), Dorotheus, 1st century BC, to name the largest texts still available now, seems to me qute a stretch.   We have hints, ideas, many questions, and not real foundation. 
<br>
<br>Ptolemy and Vettius Valens, make an effort to link Aristotelian ideas with Astrology, and also Valens, to Stoic ideas. &nbsp; For example, we find the 4 Elements theory in Ptolemy and Valens, &nbsp;discussed by Aristotle, Empedocles, and then the Stoics. &nbsp; But neither Aristotle, Empedocles nor the Stoics were astrologers, they did not leave any astrological writings to my knowledge. &nbsp; So it seems more likely that Ptolemy was trying to find a philosophical support using the very famous at the time Aristotle, in order to express an astrological system with a philosophical foundation. &nbsp;  Platon in Timaeus had described an ideal ancient city reminiscent of a cosmological system, but not an obvious astrological foundation. &nbsp; Indeed, it seems to me  that these astrologers, in the effervescent intellectual times of Alexandria of the 1st century AD, perhaps before and after that, were trying to understand books and ideas that were long gone. &nbsp; Vettius Valens was travelling far and wide trying to find the source and secrets of an astrology whose source was in the distant past.  All these are quite a contrast to the Indian writings. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Indian Astrology and Sankhya</strong>
<br>
<br>Indian astrology on the contrary, is based on a philosohical system, or at least it uses philosophical ideas with enormous roots in Indian philosophy, and this is Samkhya philosophy. &nbsp; In the 1980s and 90s R. Santhanam and Kapoor produced their english translation of Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra, by Rishi Parasara, followed by the translation of G Sharma, and it became the foremost authoritative book, in and outside of India, &nbsp;and the most respected book.  Likewise, the first few chapters of Lomasha Samhita were published on the Saptarishis.com website in the 2010s.  Both Lomasha and&nbsp; Parasara are long known to be some of the 18 Rishis (Sages) who taught Astrology to mankind.  &nbsp;The first few chapters of BPHS and Lomasha do contain delineations of astrological ideas in terms of Shankhya.  &nbsp;Most importantly the planets are understood from the Gunas, Elements, Doshas and these principles are solid known basic principles in several ancient Indian schools of philosophy. &nbsp; These are clear Shankhya notions that are discussed in the root text of Shankhya by Kapila, and also discussed at length in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Puranas. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br>Both texts are quite similar in approach, showing astrological teachings being given to a chosen student, and they write about the  role of Krishna, Vishnu, as main founding God, each being an image of the same figure, and then about many deities and gods associated with the planets understood as Grahas.  The Grahas are not physical bodies, but deities whose role is “to give humans the fruits of their karma” to quote Parasara.  So a metaphysical and spiritual foundation is given from the start.  Grahas or planets are deities and not physical bodies, and they possess qualities such as Gunas, they possess Elements, which are not described in materialistic terms in Indian philosophy as they are in Greek philosophy, and Grahas then possess many other qualities and associations with the material worlds, but these associations are given AFTER the divine or spiritual associations to deities and Gunas are given.  Meaning the material crystallisations are a result of the spiritual precipitations into matter. 
<br>
<br>Shankhya and Indian philosophy in general, are difficult texts to approach from a westerner's point of view. &nbsp; Shankhya describes a world whose origin is not physical.  Actually in Genesis an immaterial origin is also shown.  Here is Genesis 1, International translation:
<br>
<br>“In the beginning&nbsp;God created&nbsp;the heavens&nbsp;and the earth.&nbsp;2&nbsp;Now the earth was formless&nbsp;and empty,&nbsp;darkness was over the surface of the deep,&nbsp;and the Spirit of God&nbsp;was hovering&nbsp;over the waters.” 
<br>
<br>These are very allusive and evocative images which are deep and mystical and would require extended study.  But Genesis and the Bible are not used in western astrological texts. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br>Shamhya is.  It is often described as a dualistic philosophy, because it holds 2 realities as basic principles of the world, Purusha and Prakriti. &nbsp;Of these, Purusha is seen as Self, or Spirit, or Consciousness. &nbsp;Some writers have seen Purusha as synonimous with Atman, or Soul. &nbsp;Purusha is a divine essence, it is spiritual. &nbsp;Purusha relates to an individual identity as being spiritual and being a spirit.  Purusha being consciousness or spirit is totally immaterial. And this is a very important notion, because if Purusha is immaterial it is not perceivable by the senses !   
<br>
<br>On the contrary Prakriti is nature.  Actually Prakriti is unmanifest Nature.  And Shankhya being an enumeration of a number of principle present in the world, describes its precipitation into matter.   During incarnation, Prakriti begins from being unmanifest,  on to a state of mind called Mahat, or Budhi, which intellects the world, to a more disctint individual awareness point of view which is Ahamkara.   This Ahamkara is part of the mind.  Ahamakara we call Ego in the west.  It is the state of being, or having a separate identity from other beings.  But for Shankhya, this is an illusion of being separate, since at the core we are Purusha, we are one.  But Purusha is being such an elevated position of consciousness, as being almost unreachable to people.  
<br>
<br>So Prakriti then continues its materialisation into the 3 Gunas, then differents instruments called the 5 subtle elements, 5 gross elements , 5 organs of cognition and action.  
<br>
<br>So the Prakriti as nature is a process by which consciousness descends into physical matter, through the mind, Ego, subtle organs of cognitions, 5 senses of perceptions and then organs used in order to act upon the world.  This concludes the materialisation into physical matter of a consciousness which had decided to create or enjoy life, but that was Purusha or spirit in essence. 
<br>
<br>So the 5 senses of Prakriti are able to perceive nature to some extent at least.  Shankhya  describes Prakriti at length with its 24 tattvas, or true principles, given above, the last tattva the 25th being Purusha itself, but this one is transcendant, and is not perceivable by the Senses.   See the table below for the map of Prakriti. 
<br>
<br>So these Sankhya concepts forming a description of what ancient Sages have “seen” of the world, with its origin outside any access by the senses, we can see how our modern world will have difficulty accepting such a viewpoint.   Most philosophical systems born in the west since the Renaissance, and even before, are reasonned out processes and intellectual constructions.   All modern sciences are attempting to describe what they see in matter and nature, and from that extrapolate to what the world must be like.  They use instruments to refine what the senses fail to see, like microscopes, telescopes.    Still they are unable to locate consciousness, love,  God, Spirit, within matter.   For the most part, they are actually surprisingly uninterested in these things.   
<br>
<br>Since the Renaissance and what we can call the birth of modern science, the approach to knowledge took on a decidedly materialistic approach.  Before the Renaissance the savants were called Natural Philosophers.   They were looking at spirituality and nature in an inclusive, non materialistic way.  They did not say we separate spirit which we will not study, and matter which we will study.  They were studying chemistry, alchemy, medicine, astrology, religion without the strange distinction of modern times.  They had not taken on the skepticism and materialism which have infused every aspect of modern life.  They began their inquiry from the opposite side from where the Shankhya Rishis started out.  Those Rishis worked from yogic consciousness which they elaborated on in Vedic texts.   They explained that once their mind where cleared of obstructions thru their extended meditative disciplines, they were able to see the world and its myriad aspect, as maya or an illusory image.   But the underlying principles of the world are what they describe in Shankhya and other philosophical systems like Advaita and Yoga and the Vedas and Puranas.   To us then, who cannot have access to expanded consciousness, Shankhya seems pure speculation as we cannot see, smell, hear or feel Purusha, and we cannot prove, the key word of western science, its existence. Nor can we prove the Gunas are present in nature or human beings.  We can say there is maybe an energy there.  Now to a Rishi who sees the world outside of physical eyes or senses, modern science, by looking only at Prakriti, nature, is using a part of the mind that Shankhya has already&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Pierre T jan. 2018</p><p></p>
