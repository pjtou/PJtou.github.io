                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"></p><p><strong>Philosophical Foundation</strong></p><p>In the piece I will try to show some similarities and differences between philosophical foundation used in Hellenistic Astrology and Hindu Astrology, we will try to see how their philosophical foundation informs astrological symbols and helps to understand the purpose of astrology. &nbsp;My contention is that the Shankhya foundation in Indian astrology while similar to some of Plato's ideas, offers a more integrated basis to astrology, that did the several philosophical schools of Greek philosophy.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Greek Astrology and Philosophy&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>What is called western astrology, can be thought to stem from Persian / Mesopotamian / Egyptian astrology, given what is left from hellenistic Antiquity. &nbsp;The texts we still have are not clear on this point, because the the earliest authors or Sages have not survived in print, nor had their understanding really made it across time to Dorotheus de Sidon, 1st century AD, Ptolemy, Vettius Valens, both 2nd century AD and other like Hephaisto of Thebes, 5th century AD. &nbsp; But the earlier astrologers referenced by them were Berossus, Asclepius, Nechepso and Petosiris, the last 2 being Egyptians. &nbsp;Their time period is lost, though scholars puts them in the last 2nd or 3rd centuries before JC. &nbsp;But there are references to the Tomb of Petosiris in 4th century BCE, and of Nechepso being from 7th century BCE on a encyclpedic articles under their name. &nbsp;Another ancient divine figure is of course, Hermes, date unknown. </p><p>The astrology books and methods written in Greek, were transmitted to us via the Persians, Arabs around the 8th century, and then via European astrologers of the middle age.   So it was something of a lost art at the time of Valens, and therefore there wasn’t nor is there now, a solid cosmological and philosophical foundation, that this writer is aware of. &nbsp; There may have been such a unique foundation in the Babylonian or Mesopotamian astrology, but it hasnt made it to us. &nbsp; The reason I am writing this is that the 12 signs and zodiac came from Mespopotamia, before the 3rd and 4th century, probably before the 6th cenury. &nbsp;The zodiac was sidereal because all extent ancient chart starting from 410 BCE were sidereal. &nbsp; We do not have a single tropical chart in ancient Greek astrology even. &nbsp; But as for Mesopotamian astrology, the sytem has not made it to us, and for this reason, nearly all scholars believe that natal astrology, astrology for human beings is a Greek modification or invention, which I do not believe.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course there were philosophical elements in those Greek texts.  Recent writers such as Robert Schmidt have made a fascinating linguistic study of the Greek texts and found elements and philosophical concepts of Form and Matter, the Same and the Other, referring to Plato and Aristotle, 3rd century BC, Empedocles 4th century BC, among other Greek philosophers, and have derived insights from these. These insights are applied to Signs, Planets and Aspects, the 3 building blocks of astrology. &nbsp; For instance Aspect is a visual term. &nbsp; Aspects were sometimes named "glances" in Valens and the Greek philosophical ideas associated with looking at an object became a focus for understanding relations between planets. &nbsp;So if there is an Aspect between 2 planets, it means that one or both planets, are able to see the other, and therefore connect, impart a signification one to the other.</p>For Plato, according to a piece on Wikipedia, "philosophers considered the heavens to be moved by immaterial agents. Plato believed the cause to be a world-soul, created according to mathematical principles, which governed the daily motion of the heavens (the motion of the Same) and the opposed motions of the planets along the zodiac (the motion of the Different).[Cornford] &nbsp; In Plato the Form is mathematically ordered and numbers were very important in its construction.<br>This view relates to the idea in Surya Siddantha and Shankhya that the original principle or "idea" of the world is not material. &nbsp; In Shankhya, Purusha or Spirit, or Consciousness, is eternal and immaterial, it always exists, and is a first cause of everything that exists. &nbsp; For Plato, the Form (capitalised) is the original principle hidden behind the physical world of nature and matter. &nbsp; This Form is divine, imbued with awareness and causing things. &nbsp;So there is similarity or agreement with Shankhya that nature (Prakriti in Shankhya) is animated by a mysterious imperceptible agent, which is Purusha, Spirit, or the Form in Plato. &nbsp; Also, Shankhya itself is a word meaning enumeration or number, which is intriguing in relation to the number system that Plato and Pythagoras say orders the universe.&nbsp;<br><p><br>In De Mundo, Aristotle or a writer thought to be Aristotle mentions a theory of rotating planetary Spheres being the source of all events on earth. &nbsp; This is quite intriguing because such a cosmos is ordered by deities, who arrange all events for people, in Surya Siddantha. &nbsp; This is a very old (date unknown though) and sacred Indian sanskrit text considered an astronomical and cosmological model of the Divine Planets and their theory. &nbsp;This texts was writen by Rishis, Sages in traditional Indian lore. &nbsp;To find this mention of Planetary Spheres in (or claimed to be from) Aristotle and also in Ptolemy (Almagest) shows a link between India and the Middle east. &nbsp;Because Surya Siddantha has a solid history and foundation in India, it would negate its origin in the Middle east.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet in Plato there are concepts reminiscent of the Divine Planets. &nbsp;Plato posits a world of Forms, which are uncreated, not perceivable be the senses, and always exist. &nbsp;We will see that this even connects with the Shankhya notion of Purusha we will describe. &nbsp; But those Divine Planets and their revolutions can possibly be related to the Planetary Spheres mentionned in De Mundo.</p><p>Ptolemy and Vettius Valens make an effort to link Aristotelian ideas with Astrology, and also Valens, to Stoic ideas. &nbsp; For example, we find the 4 Elements theory in Ptolemy and Valens, &nbsp;discussed by Aristotle, Empedocles, and then the Stoics. &nbsp; But neither Aristotle, Empedocles and Plato were astrologers, they did not leave any astrological writings to my knowledge. &nbsp; <br>The case of Ptolemy is very interesting because the influence of Aristotle on him shows as a season-based set of influence bearing on zodiac signs and planets. &nbsp; The ratio of humidity, dryness, heat and cold, coming from Aristotle, explains to himself and then Ptolemy the effects and causes of the 4 Elements, and then of planets. &nbsp; And these quite material effects are seen as causal for Ptolemy, meaning, seasons, temperature, wetness begin to be causal on the affairs of men and countries. &nbsp;Ptolemy became enormously influential in the centuries after his life, and his natural causal views remained very important for astrologers using his tropical zodiac in the western world to this day. &nbsp; This despite several philosophers like Plotinus (3rd century AD) deriding the notion of planets causing events : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp;"-If one says that if the bird flies high is signifies some high heroic deed. &nbsp;But if because, looking at the stars, they announce what has happened to particular people, they adduce this as evidence that the happenings were caused by the stars, then in the same way, birds would be the causes of what they indicate, and so would everything at which the soothsayers look when they foretell."<br>The debate between natural causes and astrology being signs to events remained throughout history in Europe, in fact it is still prevalent today. &nbsp; And the natural causes prevailed often, but we will see how this view wasnt supported in India.&nbsp;<br>So it seems more likely that Ptolemy was trying to find a philosophical support using the very famous at the time Aristotle, in order to elaborate an astrological system with a philosophical foundation. &nbsp;</p><p>Platon in Timaeus had also described an ideal ancient city perhaps reminiscent of a cosmological system, but not an obvious astrological foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some recent writers like Liz Greene, have interpreted Planets in terms of Greek mythology, (Planets of Fate, Weiser, 1985). &nbsp; She derived insights on the meaning of planets from the Greeek gods apparented to them. &nbsp; It is quite interesting, but if we bear in mind that the Astrology written in Greek at those times does not seem to come from the pre-Christian Greek culture, but rather from ancient Persia, Mesopotamia, and probably Egypt. &nbsp;So if the gods named in Greek, like Zeus for Jupiter, Chronos for Saturn, Hermes for Mercury etc. &nbsp;do have a correlation to the planets, the idea to seek interpretive material from Greek mythology may be somewhat daring or speculative. &nbsp;She wrote for instance, that Zeus is known for his love affairs and jealousies, and from this deems Jupiter a promiscuous lover ready to cheat his wife. &nbsp; Such views would not be possible in eastern Indian astrology, which views Jupiter as a Brahmin, an adviser, a guru, a spiritual person. &nbsp; At any rate, a philosophical foundation to the cosmology of middle-eastern astrology written in Greek in the first few centuries AD, is not there. &nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, it seems that these astrologers of the early middle east, in the effervescent intellectual times of Alexandria of the 1st century AD, and probably sometime before and after that, were trying to understand books and ideas that were long gone. &nbsp; Vettius Valens was travelling far and wide trying to find the source and secrets of an astrology whose source was in the distant past. &nbsp;There was metaphysical ideas throughout Plato and Greek philosophers, but a native &nbsp;astrological philosophy is not imbred in the philosophy of those times. &nbsp;All these are quite a contrast to the Indian writings. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Indian Astrology and Sankhya</strong>
<br>
<br>Indian astrology on the contrary, is based on a philosophical system, even a cosmological scheme, or at least it uses philosophical ideas with enormous roots in Indian philosophy, and for this there are 2 condidates, &nbsp;Samkhya philosophy and the Surya Siddantha. &nbsp; In the 1980s and 90s R. Santhanam and Kapoor produced their english translation of Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra (2), by Rishi Parasara, followed by the translation of G Sharma, and it became the foremost authoritative book, in and outside of India.  Likewise, the first few chapters of Lomasha Samhita were published on the Saptarishis.com website in the 2010s.  Both Lomasha and&nbsp; Parasara are long known to be some of the 18 Rishis (Sages) who taught Astrology to mankind.  &nbsp;The first few chapters of BPHS and Lomasha do contain delineations of astrological ideas in terms of Shankhya.  &nbsp;Most importantly the planets are understood from the Gunas, Elements, Doshas and these principles are solid known basic principles in several ancient Indian schools of philosophy and Ayurveda. &nbsp; These are clear Shankhya notions that are discussed in the root text of Shankhya by Kapila, and also discussed at length in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Puranas. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br>Both texts, BPHS and Lomasha are quite similar in approach, showing astrological teachings being given to a chosen student, and they write about the  role of Krishna, Vishnu, as main founding God, each being an image of the same figure, and then about many deities and gods associated with the planets understood as Grahas. &nbsp;The Grahas are not physical bodies, but deities whose role is “to give humans the fruits of their karma” to quote Parasara. &nbsp; A similar idea of Planets not being bodies but deities is present in Surya Siddantha and the Puranas (Bhagavata Purana). &nbsp; So a metaphysical and spiritual foundation is given from the start.  Grahas or planets are deities and not physical bodies, and they possess qualities such as Gunas, they possess Elements, which are not described in materialistic terms in Indian philosophy as they are in Greek philosophy, and Grahas then possess many other qualities and associations with the material worlds, but these associations are given AFTER the divine or spiritual associations to deities and Gunas are given.  Meaning the material crystallisations are a result of the spiritual precipitations into matter. 
<br>
<br>Shankhya and Indian philosophy in general, are difficult texts to approach from a westerner's point of view. &nbsp; Shankhya describes a world whose origin is not physical.  Actually in Genesis an immaterial origin is also shown.  Here is Genesis 1, International translation:
<br>
<br>“In the beginning&nbsp;God created&nbsp;the heavens&nbsp;and the earth.&nbsp;2&nbsp;Now the earth was formless&nbsp;and empty,&nbsp;darkness was over the surface of the deep,&nbsp;and the Spirit of God&nbsp;was hovering&nbsp;over the waters.” 
<br>
<br>These are very allusive and evocative images which are deep and mystical and would require extended study.  But Genesis and the Bible are not used in western astrological texts. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br>Shamhya is used in Indian astrology. &nbsp;It is often described as a dualistic philosophy, because it holds 2 realities as basic principles of the world, Purusha and Prakriti. &nbsp;Of these, Purusha is the Self, or Spirit, or Consciousness. &nbsp;Some writers have seen Purusha synonimous with Atman, or Soul. &nbsp;Purusha is a divine essence, it is spiritual. &nbsp;Purusha relates to an individual identity as being spiritual and being a spirit.  Purusha is totally immaterial. And this is a very important notion, because if Purusha is immaterial it is not perceivable by the senses !   
<br>
<br>On the contrary Prakriti is nature.  Actually Prakriti is unmanifest Nature.  And Shankhya being an enumeration (the word means number) of a many principles present in the world, describes its precipitation into matter.   During incarnation, Prakriti begins from being unmanifest,  on to a state of mind called Mahat, or Budhi, which intellects the world, to a more disctint individual awareness point of view which is Ahamkara.   This Ahamkara is part of the mind.  Ahamakara we call Ego in the west.  It is the state of being, or having a separate identity from other beings.  But for Shankhya, this is an illusion of being separate, since at the unmanifested core there is Purusha, we are Purusha, we are one.  But Purusha being such an elevated position of consciousness, as being almost unreachable to people.</p><p>Parasara gives Ahamkara to the moon. &nbsp;He gives the Self or the Soul to the Sun, though it is unclear that this Soul is the ONE Soul, or more an individual Spirit. &nbsp; It actually is more like an individual Spirit of a human being, because every chart has a sun somewhere which is related to the unique Self of that person. &nbsp; This is reminiscent of Purusha. &nbsp;</p><p>Prakriti then continues its incarnation, materialisation into the 3 Gunas, then differents instruments called the 5 subtle elements, 5 gross elements , 5 organs of cognition and action.  
<br>Prakriti as nature is a process by which consciousness descends into physical matter, through the mind, Ego, subtle organs of cognitions, 5 senses of perceptions and then organs used in order to act upon the world.  This concludes the materialisation into physical matter of a consciousness which had, it is surmissed, decided to create, enjoy, manifest life, on another level from its own.</p><p>Parasara gives the 5 elements to the 5 Starry planets. &nbsp;They are in the usual Indian order of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, for fire, earth, ether, water and air. &nbsp; Note that in older western texts like Lilly these 5 elements were still remembered bu they were then forgotten.<br>
<br>The 5 senses of Prakriti are able to perceive nature to some extent at least.  Shankhya  describes Prakriti at length with its 24 tattvas, or true principles, given above. &nbsp;There is a last tattva, the 25th being Purusha itself, &nbsp;and this one is transcendant, and is not perceivable by the Senses.   See the table below for the map of Prakriti. 
<br>
<br>So these Sankhya concepts forming a description of what ancient Sages have “seen” of the world, with its origin outside any access by the senses, we can see how our modern world will have difficulty accepting such a viewpoint.   Most philosophical systems born in the west since the Renaissance, and even before, are reasonned out processes and intellectual constructions.   All modern sciences are attempting to describe what they see in matter and nature, and from that extrapolate to what the world must be like.  They use instruments to refine what the senses fail to see, like microscopes, telescopes.    Still they are unable to locate consciousness, love,  God, Spirit, within matter. &nbsp;For the most part, they are actually surprisingly uninterested in these things. &nbsp; We they cannot see must not exist, they tell us. &nbsp;Dont speculate on God, they tell us.<br>
<br>Since the Renaissance and what we can call the birth of modern science, the approach to knowledge took on a decidedly materialistic approach.  Before the Renaissance the savants were called Natural Philosophers.   They were looking at spirituality and nature in an inclusive, non materialistic way.  They did not say we separate spirit which we will not study, and matter which we will study.  They were studying chemistry, alchemy, medicine, astrology, religion without the skeptical distinction of modern times.  They had not taken on the skepticism and materialism which have infused every aspect of modern life.  They began their inquiry from the opposite side from where the Shankhya Rishis started out.  Those Rishis worked from yogic consciousness which they elaborated on in Vedic texts.   They explained that once their mind where cleared of obstructions thru their extended meditative disciplines, they were able to see the world and its myriad aspect, as maya or an illusory image.   But the underlying principles of the world are what they describe in Shankhya and other philosophical systems like Advaita and Yoga and the Vedas and Puranas.   To us then, who cannot have access to expanded consciousness, Shankhya seems pure speculation as we cannot see, smell, hear or feel Purusha, and we cannot prove, the key word of western science, its existence. Nor can we prove the Gunas are present in nature or human beings. &nbsp;We can say there maybe an energy there. &nbsp;But we are unsure what it is. &nbsp;We are not trained to know it. &nbsp; Now to a Rishi who sees the world outside of physical eyes or senses, modern science, by looking only at Prakriti, nature, is using a part of the mind, Mahat, Budhi, and Ahamkara, that Shankhya has described as fragmented, a part of the mind not being the whole of consciousness. &nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Pierre T fev. 2018</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>1 &nbsp;Hellenistic Astrology, Chris Brennan, 2017, Amor Fati Publications, page 152.</p><p>2 &nbsp;Brihat Parasata Hora Sastra, transl.
