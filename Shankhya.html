                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead"></p><p><strong>Greek and Egyptian Astrology&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In what is called western astrology, which is more like the remnant of Egyptian/Mesopotamian/Persian astrology from the middle east transmitted to us via the Arabs, and then via European astrologers of the middle age, there is no discernible philosophical foundation, that this writer is aware of. &nbsp;
<br>Recent writers such as Robert Schmidt have made a fascinating linguistic study of the Greek texts and found intriguing hints of philosophical concepts of Form and Matter, refering to Aristotle, Empedocles 7th century BC, among other Greek philosophers, and have derived insights from these. These insights are applied to Signs, Planets and Aspects, the 3 building blocks of astrology.  But a whole cosmological or philosophical foundation to the astrology of Ptolemy, V. Valens, Dorotheus, to name the largest texts still available now, is still not clearly seen. 
<br>Ptolemy and Vettius Valens, in the 2nd century AD, make an effort to link Aristotelian ideas with Astrology, and also for Valens, to Stoic ideas. &nbsp; For example, we find the 4 Elements theory in Ptolemy and Valens, &nbsp;discussed by Aristotle, Empedocles, and then the Stoics. &nbsp; But neither Aristotle, Empedocles nor the Stoics were astrologers, they did not leave any astrological writings to my knowledge. &nbsp; So it seems more likely that Ptolemy was trying to find a philosophical support using Aristotle, in order to express an astrological system with a philosophical foundation. &nbsp;  Also in Dorotheus de Sidon, 1th Century AD, or Ptolemy and Valens, astrology and its cosmology has any particular philosophy underlying it.   Platon in Timaeus had described an ideal ancient city reminiscent of a cosmological system, but not an obvious astrological foundation. &nbsp; Indeed, it seems to me very strongly that these astrologers, in the effervescent Alexandria of the 1st century AD, before and after the time of JC actually, were trying to understand books and ideas that were long gone. &nbsp; Vettius Valens was travelling far and wide trying to find the source and secrets of an astrology whose source was in the distant past.  All these are quite a contrast to the Indian writings. &nbsp;
<br>
<br><strong>Indian Astrology and Sankhya
</strong><br></p><p>Indian astrology on the contrary, is based on a philosohical system, or at least it uses philosophical ideas with enormous roots in Indian philosophy, and this is Samkhya. &nbsp; In the 1980s and 90s R. Santhanam and Kapoor produced their english translation of Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra, by Rishi Parasara, followed by the translation of G Sharma, and it became the foremost authoritative book, in and outside of India, &nbsp;and the most respected book.  Likewise, the first few chapters of Lomasha Samhita were published on the SaptaRishi website in the 2010s.  Both Lomasha and&nbsp; Parasara are long known to be part of the 18 Rishis (Sages) who taught Astrology for mankind. &nbsp;And the first few chapters of BPHS and Lomasha DO contain a delineation of astrological ideas in terms of Shankhya. &nbsp;Most importantly the planets are understood from the Gunas and Doshas. &nbsp; These are clear Shankhya notions that are discussed in the root text of Shankhya by Kapila, and also discussed at length in the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Puranas. &nbsp; 
<br>Both texts are quite similar in approach, showing astrological teachings being given to a chosen student, and expand on the role of Krishna, Vishnu, and then deities and god associated with the planets understood as Grahas, which are not physical bodies, but deities whose role is “to give humans the fruits of their karma” to quote Parasara.  So a metaphysical and spiritual foundation is given from the start. 
<br>Shankhya and Indian philosophy in general, are difficult texts to approach from a westerner's point of view. &nbsp; Shankhya describes a world whose origin is not material.  Actually in Genesis an immaterial origin is also shown.  But Genesis and the Bible are not used in western astrological texts. &nbsp; Shamhya is.  It is often described as a dualistic philosophy, because it holds 2 realities as basic principles of the world, Purusha and Prakriti. &nbsp;Of these, Purusha is seen as Self, or Spirit, or Consciousness. &nbsp;Some writers have seen Purusha as synonimous with Atman, or Soul. &nbsp;Purusha is a divine essence, it is spiritual. &nbsp;Purusha being Consciousness or Spirit is totally immaterial. &nbsp; And this is a very important notion, because Purusha being immaterial means it is NOT perceivable by the senses ! &nbsp; On the contrary Prakriti is nature, or matter, the the 5 senses are able to perceive a large part of nature. &nbsp;Shankhya proceeds to describe Prakriti at length with its 24 tattvas, or true principles, the last tattva the 25th being Purusha itself, but this one is transcendant, meaning not perceivable by the Senses. &nbsp;
<br>So these Sankhya concepts forming a description of what ancient Sages have SEEN of the world, with its origin being NOT perceivable by the Senses, we can see how our modern world will have difficulty accepting such a point of view. &nbsp; All philosophical systems born in the west since the Renaissance, and even before, are reasonned out processes and intellectual constructions. &nbsp; All modern sciences are attempting to describe what they see in matter and nature, and from that extrapolate to what the world must be like. &nbsp;They use instruments to refine what the senses fail to see, like microscopes, telescope. &nbsp; &nbsp;Still they are unable to locate consciousness, love, &nbsp;God, Spirit, within matter. &nbsp; They begin their inquiry from the opposite side from where the Shankhya Rishis started out. &nbsp;Those Rishis worked from yogic consciousness which they elaborated on in Vedic texts. &nbsp; They explain that once their mind where cleared of obstructions thru their meditative disciplines, they were able to see the world, which they describe in Shankhya. &nbsp; To us then, who cannot have access to expanded consciousness, Shankhya seems pure speculation as we cannot see, smell, hear or feel Purusha, and we cannot PROVE, the key word of western science, its existence.  Nor can we prove the Gunas are present in nature or human beings.   Now to a Rishi who SEES the world outside of physical eyes or senses, modern Science, by looking only at Prakriti, nature, is necessarily blind, hence its vision and perception is totally fragmented, and it will miss Purusha entirely.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I refer to my discussions of Gunas and Doshas on this site, and in BPHS.
